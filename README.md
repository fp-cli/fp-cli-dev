fin-cli/fin-cli-dev
=================

Sets up a FIN-CLI development environment that allows for easy development across all packages.

This allows easy development across all packages and contains additional maintenance commands that simplify repository chores and the release process.

## Installation

If you normally use FIN-CLI on your web host or via Brew, you're most likely using the Phar executable (`fin-cli.phar`). This Phar executable file is the "built", singular version of FIN-CLI. It is compiled from a couple dozen repositories in the FIN-CLI GitHub organization.

In order to make code changes to FIN-CLI, you'll need to set up this `fin-cli-dev` development environment on your local machine. The setup process will:

1. Clone all relevant packages from the `fin-cli` GitHub organization into the `fin-cli-dev` folder, and
2. Install all Composer dependencies for a complete `fin-cli-bundle` setup, while symlinking all of the previously cloned packages into the Composer `vendor` folder.
3. Symlink all folder in `vendor` into corresponding `vendor` folders in each repository, thus making the centralized functionality based on Composer available in each repository subfolder.

Before you can proceed further, you'll need to make sure you have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), PHP, and a functioning MySQL or MariaDB server on your local machine.

Once the prerequisites are met, clone the GitHub repository and run the installation process:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fin-cli/fin-cli-dev fin-cli-dev
cd fin-cli-dev
composer install
composer prepare-tests
```

## Development

Every subfolder is a proper clone of the corresponding GitHub repository. This means that you can create new branches, make your changes, commit to the new branch and then submit as pull-request, all from within these folders.

Unless you have commit access to the repository, you'll need to fork the repository in order to push your feature branch. [GitHub's CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) is pretty helpful for this:

```bash
cd core-command
gh repo fork
```

As the folders are also symlinked into the Composer `vendor` folder, you will always have the latest changes available when running FIN-CLI through the `vendor/bin/wp` executable.
